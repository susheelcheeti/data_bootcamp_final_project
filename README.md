This project was completed by Susheel Cheeti in partial fulfillment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2021. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para- phrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography. 

And I understand that:

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

In this analysis, we sought to dig deeper into the ever-expanding realm of cryptocurrency and quantitative hedge fund strategies. In recent years, we have witnessed an astronomical surge in crypto interest among investors everywhere. No longer are equities/bonds/etc. the sole money makers – rather, crypto is delivering high, quick returns, turning pennies into millions. The questions we thus sought to answer was, "How do crypto returns differ among high and low market cap/volume cryptos (i.e. do cryptos with high volumes or high market caps generally deliver the greatest annual returns, or is there opportunity in the overlooked, low volume/market cap market)?" and "Between high and low volume/market cap cryptos, which market is more suitable for high frequency trading strategies (HFT)?" The former question assumes a more fundamental long-term approach (looking at yearly returns), which we felt would be suitably complemented by a day trading outlook through the second question. HFT (second question) has become popular among quantitative hedge funds who seek to predict market prices and conduct arbitrage, which should theoretically be applicable to the crypto market; thus, we wanted to see which cryptos this day-trading strategy would be ideal for.
